# Cloud SQL Multicluster with a TLS Frontend 

This directory deploys the [Cloud SQL + Multicluster](/extras/cloudsql-multicluster/README.md) flavor of Bank of Anthos, but configures the Multi-cluster Ingress resource to use TLS with self-signed certificates, and enforces an HTTP->HTTPS redirect for all inbound traffic.
